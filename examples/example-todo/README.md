This is a very simple todo application. It aims to show ...

 * How to write some basic tests against end points.
 * How to test for some tests to be expecting success, and some to be expecting failure.
 * How to take cookies into account (like logging in).

It's primarily to provide some code samples using axum-test. It is not intended to be an example of how to build a todo application.
